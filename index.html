			<p>This navigation is simplistic and very clean. This goes hand in hand with the "less is more" concept. The font, in my opinion, fits right in with the blog type of fashion. The white space gives the words breathing space, this works because the rest of the page is a little cluttered and filled with many different colors.</p>

			<h1 id="header">Header</h1>

			<p>This website sells sunglasses and watches. The colors for the logo in the header are appropriate because it reminds people of the beach which is what their home photo is. The setup for the navigation is interesting because it is on both sides of the logo. This type of navigation layout works for them because their target audience is young and young people are able to navigate through sites easily. Overall, I liked this navigation because of how simple and effective the layout is.</p>

			<h1 id="cta">Call To Action</h1>
			<img src="img/cta.png" alt="cta" id="ctaimg">
			<h6>Thursday, May 7th, 2015</h6>
			<p>This call to action, to me, is very pleasing to my eye. The website is about ice cream and the colors suite it well due to the fact that he is targeting children. The font also goes well with the kid attraction. The font is very cury which becomes inviting. The border is in the zig-zag shape, which gives it a little sillyness. Overall, this gives off a friendly and fruity vibe which pairs perfectly with the business.</p>

			<h1 id="contact">Contact</h1>
			<img src="img/contact.png" alt="contact" id="contactimg">
			<h6>Thursday, May 7th, 2015</h6>
			<p>This contact form amaaaazed me when I first saw it. It offers the option of sending them an email very simply or contacting them by phone. The layout of this form is very appealing to my eyes because it is balanced with information on both sides. They even used this page to promote the FB page in a very subtle way.</p>
