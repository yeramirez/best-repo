			<p>This navigation is simplistic and very clean. This goes hand in hand with the "less is more" concept. The font, in my opinion, fits right in with the blog type of fashion. The white space gives the words breathing space, this works because the rest of the page is a little cluttered and filled with many different colors.</p>

			<h1 id="cta">Call To Action</h1>

			<p>This call to action, to me, is very pleasing to my eye. The website is about ice cream and the colors suite it well due to the fact that he is targeting kids. The font also goes well with the kid attraction. Overall, this gives off a friendly vibe.</p>
